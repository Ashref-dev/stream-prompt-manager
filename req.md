reqs:
Stream prompt should first of all and above all use torso instead of neon very similar just slight changes Second thing right now the system has no sorting option So when I see the multiple cards that could in the prompts I can sort them by Some kind of tag or like I can't afford or sort by recency or sort by tag or filter by tag or anything So I'd like a bar at the top a thin horizontal line with like toggles that have the tag names inside them if I click a toggle it gets toggled and a filter by that and I can click multiple Like tags to toggle fill filtering whether that's like the quickest most efficient user friendly way to do it I think so yeah, that's the first improvement you should do second improvement. I should be able to actually Edit tag colors. So when I when I am adding a tag to the card they get They get the tags colors. I understand that color automatically But now I'd like have to have a like a settings page that shows me all of the tags I currently have and their color code So no two tags should have the same color at least they should have like different to use you know make me some kind of system where we have like a very large number of hues and Cough a color to accomplish for a very large number of tags that way When tag when I add a tag like a cuss when I add manual tag instead of being gray and I can't change it It actually gets colored correctly That's the objective apart from that Give me like let's say you think about this, but I want some kind of like tabs that for example I I want to like that Let's say I want to create like a custom let's call it a group or tab where I can see these tabs somewhere maybe at the top and I can click this group and wake when I click the group I can see the prompts added to that group For example, I have like UX thinking prompt and another front-end prompt I can create a group and call it a landing page flow and I can add specific Prompts to that group, you know, that's what I would like to have So yeah, the ability to actually group. Let's call it a stack. Let's call it a stack. I can group a stack Because I wanted easy for me to hey, I opened the website I click the landing page Group or landing page stack and I see all of my prompts that I have made specifically for working on landing pages easy for me to copy paste and Inside of this groups feature. I would like it to give me like the option Along with tags like the role and output and drew is our context tags that are already existing in the prompts If a prompt is part of a group, I should be able to number them For example, if I create a landing page group stack I can like put three prompts there and put The tag one or two or three to those prompts or number them because this is the first one This is the second one, you know. Yeah, so that's a Big idea I want to do honestly and at the same time everything must be modern elegant and Consistent and preferably also perfectly responsive. So it works on mobile too But yeah, those are the needed improvements apart from the torso migration, of course code must be clean organized reuse Use components as much as possible. Of course, we don't want that code and yeah
